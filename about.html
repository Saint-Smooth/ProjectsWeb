		<h2> Our mission, our values, our Family.</h2>
		<p> Aztec boxing was founded in 2022 by Lenin de la Cruz. 
		Lenin who rose from Sinaloa has come to Australia with the purpose of spreading the unique Aztec philosophy mixed 
		with the rumbling Mexican school of boxing. His method of teaching mainly emphasises technique, lethal hooks, and precise shots.</p>
		<h2> Bringin mexican style boxing to Australia</h2>
		<p> The mexican style of boxing is characterised by fierce and aggressive brawls. It emphasises relentless pressure with precise and gritty body assaults. All crowned by exceptional head movement and parry defences. </p>
